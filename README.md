# BicycleSimulator

A unity project for a VR bike simulator for the FH Hagenberg

## **Guidelines**

Do not push directly to master, create a new branch and create a pull request to merge it into master.

Names of branches should be in the following format: `feat/feature-name` or `fix/bug-name` or at the very least something understandable.

If you are unsure about something or implement a major change please request a review from another team member!

When importing Assets make sure to only use what you really need in order to avoid huge files (example don't import unused 3D models and textures)

## **Setup for VS Code**

I prefer VS Code over VS so here is a guide to set up VS Code for unity

I also added some recommended extensions for VS Code.
