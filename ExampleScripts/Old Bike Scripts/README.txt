-------BikeControllerScript.cs-----------

Important code lines for calculating the steering angle from the oculus controller are:
-)148-241
-)30-34

(so basically look for the lines with "BikeMode.Forschungsfest", here happens all the remaping ) 

-------GameControllerScript.cs-----------

Important code lines for calculating the steering angle from the oculus controller are:
-) 552-555
-) 566-569
-) 655-678

(same is with the other files, the lines with "BikeMode.Forschungsfest" are for the remapping/calculation)
